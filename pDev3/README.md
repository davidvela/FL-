simplification of the files ... 

# Parallel processing: 
* Use the batch.bat file to create more than command line session. 
* run the model in three different jupyter notebooks (duplicate the notebook as much as it's desired): 
    * FPDL5_1 - numeric 
    * FPDL5_2 - category 2: ><60
    * FPDL5_4 - category 4: 23-60-93

GPU improvements in process...
